This site showcases my capstone project and demonstrates my skills in software design, algorithms, and databases. The goal of this project was to complete enhancements for three categories, Category One: Software Engineering and Design, Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures, and Category Three: Databases. The original artifact, Travlr Getaways Web Application, was created in a course that focused on Full Stack development. For my capstone I developed an enhancement plan, completed a code review of the artifact, and preformed the planned enhancements. Jounral entries were also completed each week to document progress and to provide a space to reflect on the course. This capstone provided me with a challenge and show the abilities I have learned during my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU.
