    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
    <!-- self-assessment narrative here -->
    <p>During my time in the Computer Science program, I have been challenged and rewarded. Over the course of my studies, I’ve grown from a passionate learner into a capable developer equipped with the knowledge, experience, and professional mindset needed to succeed in the tech industry. The Capstone project and the creation of this ePortfolio have allowed me to consolidate my learning and show the full range of my capabilities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Throughout the program, I’ve developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. I applied these skills in multiple projects, including algorithm-driven features like sorting, searching, and path-finding solutions that are integral to effective software development. I’ve developed full-stack applications, implemented user authentication, and enhanced web systems using technologies such as MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. These experiences have taught me not just how to write clean, maintainable code but also how to design scalable systems that prioritize user needs. My work on the Travlr Getaways project is a great example. It integrates multiple technologies, manages asynchronous operations, and follows modern development standards.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Additionally, I have been able to develop my skills of working within team environments. With class discussions I have been able to share ideas and provide others with helpful feedback. Throughout the program I have also had opportunities to work in multiple groups for projects. Whether dividing tasks using Git version control or resolving merge conflicts, I’ve contributed effectively to group projects by communicating clearly and working cooperatively. These experiences have prepared me to thrive in agile teams and to adapt quickly in dynamic workplace settings. Working within team environments has helped me to develop more effective communication skills which are also helpful when working with stakeholders. Working with stakeholders was a focus with many of the courses in the program. I’ve learned to translate technical details into understandable summaries for both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Security is another area that was a big focus during my time in the program. When developing assignments and projects, secure coding was required. I had courses dedicated to authentication and data protection. Implementing secure user login systems and encrypting sensitive data taught me the importance of building systems that prioritize user safety and data integrity. Working with large datasets taught me the importance of keeping data anonymous and only requesting necessary information. Keeping users’ information confidential needs to be the highest priority.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This portfolio utilizes a technical artifact that I felt would best represent my time spent in the computer science program. From the database-driven travel application to algorithm-focused projects and a comprehensive code review, each piece demonstrates a key competency. Together, they highlight not only my coding ability but also my problem-solving approach and drive for quality. This artifact is more than just an assignment; it represents the culmination of my learning and the foundation upon which I will build my future career. Creating this ePortfolio has allowed me to critically assess and refine the work that best represents my skills. I see the value in continuous improvement and the role it plays in a professional environment. I have a better understanding of where I want to go as I enter the next phase.</p>
