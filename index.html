    <h1>Welcome to My Professional ePortfolio</h1>
    <p>This site showcases my capstone project and demonstrates my skills in software design, algorithms, and databases. 
    The goal of this project was to complete enhancements for three categories, Category One: Software Engineering and Design, 
    Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures, and Category Three: Databases. 
    The original artifact, Travlr Getaways Web Application, was created in a course that focused on Full Stack development. For my capstone I developed an enhancement plan, completed a code review of the artifact, 
    and completed the enhancements. Jounral entries were completed each week that documented progress and answered given questions. This capstone provided me with a challenge 
    and show the abilities I have learned during my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is my original artifact before I made any enhancements, <a href="https://github.com/Criswell-D/TravlrOriginal">https://github.com/Criswell-D/TravlrOriginal</a> .</p>
