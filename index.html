    <h1>Welcome to Devin Criswell's ePortfolio</h1>
    <p>This site showcases my Capstone project and demonstrates my skills in software design, algorithms, and databases. 
    The goal of this project was to complete enhancements for three categories, Category One: Software Engineering and Design, 
    Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures, and Category Three: Databases. 
    The original artifact, Travlr Getaways Web Application, was created in a course that focused on Full Stack development. During this course I needed to demonstrate my mastery of the course outcomes which are:
    <br> 
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science</li>
    <li>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts</li>
    <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices</li>
    <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals</li>
    <li>Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    For my Capstone I developed an enhancement plan, completed a code review of the artifact, 
    and performed the planned enhancements. Journal entries were also completed each week to document progress and to provide a space to reflect on the course. This Capstone provided me with a challenge 
    and a way to show the abilities I have learned during my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU.</p>
